# Simplemachines - Exo30 Firmware

Exo30 is the new 3D printer I decided to build from scratch to help people that don't want to waste time and energy to buy and configure some cheap printers like Anet A8, Creality CR-10..
In fact with the Exo30, you just need to do 2 important things:
1 - Plug It
2 - Enjoy!


That's it!

I gonna create a dedicated only shop website when the prototype will be 100% ready!
Interested? You can contact me here!
